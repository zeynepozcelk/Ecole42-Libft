The "Ecole42-Libft" project is a library of basic C functions that were implemented from scratch as part of the curriculum at Ã‰cole 42, a coding school in France.

Functions
The library includes the following functions:

- ft_memset: fills a block of memory with a specified value.
- ft_bzero: sets a block of memory to zero.
- ft_memcpy: copies a block of memory from one location to another.
- ft_memccpy: copies a block of memory from one location to another until a specified character is found.
- ft_memmove: copies a block of memory from one location to another, handling overlapping blocks correctly.
- ft_memchr: searches a block of memory for a specified character.
- ft_memcmp: compares two blocks of memory.
- ft_strlen: returns the length of a string.
- ft_strlcpy: copies a string to a specified buffer, with a specified maximum length.
- ft_strlcat: appends a string to a specified buffer, with a specified maximum length.
- ft_strchr: searches a string for a specified character.
- ft_strrchr: searches a string for a specified character, starting from the end.
- ft_strncmp: compares two strings up to a specified length.
- ft_isalpha: checks if a character is an alphabetic character.
- ft_isdigit: checks if a character is a digit.
- ft_isalnum: checks if a character is alphanumeric.
- ft_isascii: checks if a character is an ASCII character.
- ft_isprint: checks if a character is printable.
- ft_toupper: converts a character to uppercase.
- ft_tolower: converts a character to lowercase.
- ft_calloc: allocates memory and sets it to zero.
- ft_strdup: duplicates a string.
## Usage
The library can be used by including the libft.h header file in your C program and linking with the libft.a static library file.

## Conclusion
The "Ecole42-Libft" project provides a useful library of basic C functions that can be used in a wide range of applications. By following the steps outlined above, you can include this library in your C programs and take advantage of the functions it provides.
